# Summary

## Concrete

- all methods include 
  - signature (declaration)
  - implementation (body)

## Abstract

- mix 
    - some just signatures
    - some signatures with implementation


## Interface

- all signatures


# Details

Perfect — you’ve already captured the core of how these three differ!
Let’s refine **when to use each**, focusing on **intent** and **typical design scenarios**.

---

## 🧱 **Concrete Class**

### When to Use:

* You want to **create real objects** (instantiate the class).
* You have **complete implementations** for all behaviors.
* You’re not defining a generic concept — you’re defining a **specific thing**.

### Example:

```java
public class Dog {
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

✅ Use when your class stands on its own or is the **final step** in a hierarchy.

---

## 🧩 **Abstract Class**

### When to Use:

* You want to **share common code** among related subclasses.
* You have **some behaviors defined** (implemented methods) but **others left for subclasses to implement**.
* You want to **define a partial template** that all children will follow.

### Example:

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }

    public abstract void makeSound(); // No implementation
}
```

Then subclasses fill in the blanks:

```java
public class Dog extends Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

✅ Use when you want to **provide base functionality** but also **force certain methods to be implemented** by child classes.

---

## 🔌 **Interface**

### When to Use:

* You want to define a **contract** — *what* a class can do, not *how* it does it.
* You expect **unrelated classes** to share the same behavior pattern.
* You want **maximum flexibility** — a class can implement **multiple interfaces**.

### Example:

```java
public interface Flyable {
    void fly(); // signature only
}
```

Implemented by unrelated classes:

```java
public class Bird implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flapping wings!");
    }
}

public class Airplane implements Flyable {
    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Taking off!");
    }
}
```

✅ Use when you want to **define capabilities** across unrelated classes (e.g., `Flyable`, `Drivable`, `Payable`).

### 💡 Summary Table

| Type               | Has Implementation?                | Can Be Instantiated? | Typical Use Case                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Concrete Class** | ✅ All methods implemented          | ✅ Yes                | Real, usable objects                   |
| **Abstract Class** | ⚙️ Some implemented, some abstract | ❌ No                 | Shared code among related subclasses   |
| **Interface**      | ❌ None (signatures only)           | ❌ No                 | Define a shared capability or contract |

Would you like me to include this in a short visual diagram (e.g., how concrete extends abstract and implements interface)? It often helps make the relationships click.
